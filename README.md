üïµÔ∏è Browser Extension Security Check Report
Objective

Learn to identify and remove potentially harmful browser extensions that may pose security or privacy risks.
Tools Used

    Google Chrome
    Mozilla Firefox
    Search Engine for extension reputation checks (e.g., Google, Reddit, official reviews)

1. Check Browser Extensions:

Extensions can:

    Access all browsing data, including passwords and history.
    Inject ads, track activity, or steal sensitive information.
    Become malicious after updates or if sold to third parties.

2. How I Checked for Suspicious Extensions

    Opened the extensions page:
        Chrome: chrome://extensions/
        Firefox: about:addons
    Reviewed each installed extension for:
        Unfamiliar or unused names
        Excessive permissions (e.g., ‚ÄúRead and change all data on websites‚Äù)
        Poor ratings or no official source
    Searched each extension online for reviews and security alerts.
    Removed or disabled suspicious extensions.

3. Extensions Found

4. Observations

    Free VPN and coupon-related extensions often request broad permissions that can compromise security.
    Some extensions remain safe initially but can turn malicious after updates.
    Always install from the official browser web store and check reviews.

5. Best Practices

    Audit extensions regularly ‚Äî remove what you don‚Äôt use.
    Install only from trusted sources (Chrome Web Store, Mozilla Add-ons).
    Avoid installing extensions that:
        Request access to all websites.

Conclusion
Unnecessary or untrusted extensions can pose serious security risks. Regular checks and removing unused or suspicious add-ons improve privacy and reduce the chance of malware infections.
